# Shabnaz Rahman's Portfolio

Hello, i'm Shabnaz Rahman;
**Data Technician  | Level 3 Bootcamp @ JustIt**
Turning raw data into actionable insights using SQL, Python and Tableau.

1. Excel Portfolio : (https://1drv.ms/w/c/5af0de34e731787c/IQDaX3NEsJFtRKZu7Qgb3JsWAU2Az4SQ7NO-QPX4kH-aZ8Q?e=uVFqvn) - Got raw data then got results and used filters to drill down on specific topics.

📄 Description
This project illustrates my ability to clean, explore, and analyse business data using Excel.

💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
Applied UK data regulations: GDPR, Data Protection Act, and the Computer Misuse Act
Used Excel functions like SUM, AVERAGE, and SWITCH for analysis
Built Pivot Tables to segment data by customer age group, region, and gender
Conducted market breakdowns and summarised performance using dynamic filtering
Created charts and insights presentations to prepare for Power BI dashboard delivery
Practised data storytelling and reporting for senior stakeholders

2. Database Portfolio : (https://1drv.ms/w/c/5af0de34e731787c/IQBEp-XPVL9GRq1OSIfOvGw_AUYvsCiXbhupDkv-ZD96B3k?e=jV8cch)
📄 Description
This workbook demonstrates my ability to write SQL queries, understand relational data structures, and apply data modelling techniques in a business context. The tasks included interpreting data  identifying data types and entities, and writing SQL to retrieve and manipulate relevant business data. I also worked with Azure Data Studio to explore how relational databases are built, queried, and secured in the cloud.

💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
Used SQL to retrieve, filter, sort, and aggregate data
Identified primary keys and relationships between database tables
Explained relational database concepts: one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
Developed entity-relationship diagrams to represent business datasets
Applied data integrity principles such as normalization, data types, and constraints
Explored cloud-based relational databases using Azure Data Studio
Demonstrated data querying to support business insight and reporting

3. Python Portfolio : (https://1drv.ms/w/c/5af0de34e731787c/IQD6jISH6JrERLwzMtCvvdnrAXDHruxiPkT7E6XYT6R0rO8?e=mX0Dhu)
(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1x0WI1v8Ehj_uCSZEmYnUL2AP-Xtx49bg?usp=sharing)- I imported raw data using the format .csv files then use the data to create data results and visualisations

📄 Description
This workbook showcases my foundational Python skills for data analysis, automation, and basic scripting. I learned to clean, edit, and visualise data using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. The tasks also involved creating user-defined functions, handling exceptions, and applying automation techniques using loops and conditional logic — all tailored for practical business data scenarios.

💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
Wrote Python scripts using variables, loops, conditionals, and functions
Imported and manipulated datasets using Pandas DataFrames
Applied NumPy for numerical operations and statistical analysis
Created visualisations (e.g., bar charts and line graphs) using Matplotlib
Cleaned and transformed raw data (e.g., handling null values, formatting)
Automated repetitive tasks through for loops and conditional execution
Practised exception handling to build more robust scripts
Explained the role of Python in data engineering and analytics pipelines




4. Sales Cleaning data : (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t6INLDtt8qmWPbotPMFq3rU0_OmN-hqz?usp=sharing)
This is a data set where I got a raw data set and made an analysis as the outcome.
