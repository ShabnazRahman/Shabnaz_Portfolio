# Shabnaz Rahman's Portfolio

Hello, i'm Shabnaz Rahman;
**Data Technician  | Level 3 Bootcamp @ JustIt**
Turning raw data into actionable insights using SQL, Python and Tableau.

1. Excel Portfolio : (https://1drv.ms/w/c/5af0de34e731787c/IQDaX3NEsJFtRKZu7Qgb3JsWAU2Az4SQ7NO-QPX4kH-aZ8Q?e=uVFqvn) - Got raw data then got results and used filters to drill down on specific topics.

📄 Description
This project illustrates my ability to clean, explore, and analyse business data using Excel.

💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
Applied UK data regulations, including GDPR, the Data Protection Act, and the Computer Misuse Act when handling and analysing information.
Utilised core Excel functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, and SWITCH to perform efficient data analysis.
Built Pivot Tables to segment datasets by customer age group, region, and gender.
Conducted market breakdowns and produced summary insights using dynamic filtering techniques.
Created charts and insight‑driven presentations to support the development of Power BI dashboards.

2. Database Portfolio : (https://1drv.ms/w/c/5af0de34e731787c/IQBEp-XPVL9GRq1OSIfOvGw_AUYvsCiXbhupDkv-ZD96B3k?e=jV8cch)
📄 Description
This workbook demonstrates my ability to write SQL queries, understand relational data structures, and apply data modelling techniques in a business context. The tasks included interpreting data  identifying data types and entities, and writing SQL to retrieve and manipulate relevant business data. I also worked with Azure Data Studio to explore how relational databases are built, queried, and secured in the cloud.

💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
Queried databases using SQL to efficiently retrieve, filter, sort, and aggregate data.
Identified primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships across database tables.
Explained core relational database concepts, including one‑to‑many and many‑to‑many relationships.
Designed entity‑relationship (ER) diagrams to model and represent business datasets.
Applied data integrity principles such as normalisation, appropriate data types, and the use of constraints.
Explored and worked with cloud‑based relational databases using Azure Data Studio.
Performed data queries to support business insights, reporting, and decision‑making.

3. Python Portfolio : (https://1drv.ms/w/c/5af0de34e731787c/IQD6jISH6JrERLwzMtCvvdnrAXDHruxiPkT7E6XYT6R0rO8?e=mX0Dhu)
(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1x0WI1v8Ehj_uCSZEmYnUL2AP-Xtx49bg?usp=sharing)- I imported raw data using the format .csv files then use the data to create data results and visualisations

📄 Description
This workbook showcases my foundational Python skills for data analysis, automation, and basic scripting. I learned to clean, edit, and visualise data using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. The tasks also involved creating user-defined functions, handling exceptions, and applying automation techniques using loops and conditional logic — all tailored for practical business data scenarios.

💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
Developed Python scripts incorporating variables, loops, conditionals, and modular functions.
Imported, cleaned, and manipulated datasets using Pandas DataFrames.
Utilised NumPy for efficient numerical computations and statistical analysis.
Produced clear and insightful visualisations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) with Matplotlib.
Performed data cleaning and transformation tasks, including handling missing values and standardising formats.
Automated repetitive processes using loop structures and conditional logic.
Implemented exception handling to create more reliable and fault‑tolerant scripts.
Explained Python’s role within data engineering workflows and analytics pipelines.



4. Sales Cleaning data : (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t6INLDtt8qmWPbotPMFq3rU0_OmN-hqz?usp=sharing)
This is a data set where I got a raw data set and made an analysis as the outcome.
